    description=_"While the belligerence of orcs is nothing new, their intensifying attacks on a fledgling colony of elves in Pindir Forest begin to show signs of a deeper malice, forcing Galuldur, the young son of the colony's adventurous founder Galur, to venture out of his forest's friendly trees in search of help. His simple errand quickly turns into a frantic quest to unearth the roots of the mysterious evil threatening his people. As you lead him through unknown lands, Galuldur, forced to match wits with unexpected adversaries at nearly every turn in a desperate attempt to save his world,  quickly learns that the world is neither a friendly nor a simple place.
