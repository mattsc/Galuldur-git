I fear that they have set aside their differences and are planning to take over the lands of the Northmen. Unfortunately, we are in their way. As is Ultwildir. If we do not do something quickly, we will all perish."}

I need all our experienced fighters to hold off the orcs for as long as possible, and by sending my son, Elralith will know that I am serious. I will give you this letter which you must hand to Elralith personally. He will believe you when he reads what I have written. The Ultwildir elves don't like me very much because I am too ... untraditional, but Elralith still values my opinion and experience. Why else would he send a messenger to ''see how we are doing in these new woods'' every season? And besides, he must be aware of the orcish troop movements by now."}
