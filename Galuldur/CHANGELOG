----- 1.2.0, 17 May 2015 (port to Wesnoth 1.12) -----

- Ported the campaign to Wesnoth 1.12
- Adjustments to the code and the story for a variety of reasons:
  - Consistency with Grnk
  - Update dialogs, objectives, animations, unit movements, scenario setup, code
    etc. to be more to my liking and consistent with what I am doing these days.
  - Bug fixes (mostly minor)
  - However, no serious rebalancing or story changes were done, except for S6
    Southern Route (see below)
- Some other player visible changes (potentially) worth mentioning:
  - Added disclaimer that campaign does not follow Wesnoth canon
  - Renamed Altwald -> Ultwildir
  - Time of day now carries over directly from scenario to scenario (most
    scenarios)
  - S1: Added a message that the wolves are in west
  - S5: make troll ambushes weaker, to make them less of a tomato surprise
  - S6: completely rework the scenario, to avoid it being a null scenario
  -> S7: adapt to changes in S6 (e.g. make undead appear in all cases, less
    gold dropped by Norfindil, etc.)
  - S7: Added Gertburt's tomb
  - S8: Give Aher-Tot some starting units to prevent quick leader assassination
  - S9: Renamed Frank and Arthur to Fred and Ron ;-)
  - S10: Renamed Saher-Tot to The Master
  - S10: Gave the Chief some starting units


----- 1.1.1, 27 Apr 2012 -----

- Added description written by Shakeshake


----- 1.1.0, 22 Dec 2010 -----

Gameplay:
  - S10: The lizards, including their leader, now actively protect the Chief's
    side, and in particular the Chief himself
  - S10: Fixed a minor bug that sometimes kept the Elralith control menu items
    from being displayed
  - All narrator messages (except for "engineering messages" which are commented
    out) now display the Wesnoth icon.
  - S2/S4/S5: Dialog for Trolls at passes and Woses was changed so that they now
    show the unit portraits

BfW 1.9:
The main change of this release is the porting for it to work with BfW 1.9 also.
The emphasis was on keeping the differences between the 1.8 and 1.9 versions as
minimal as possible, rather than on finding the most elegant solution. This
resulted in two types of changes:

1. Changes that affect 1.9 only, that is, real syntax differences between 1.8
   and 1.9 (tested with 1.9.3):
  - Replaced flower terrain in all maps: GGf -> Gg^Efm
  - Changed 'colour' -> 'color' in S6, S7
  - Changed 'removeitem' -> 'remove_item' in S10 macros
  - Changed bonus objective formatting based on new objectives formatting style

2. Changes made to both the 1.8 and 1.9 versions:
  - Replaced core macros REDRAW, FLOATING_TEXT, CAPTURE_FILTERED_VILLAGES
    (deprecated in 1.9) by local macros
  - S4: introduced rounding for 'burnt_limit' variable
  - Sound file 'wolf-die.wav' now in local sounds/ directory
  - Macro MOVE_UNIT works differently now, requires destination to be passable
    -> need to make lava passable for unit on suicide run in S10
  - S6/S7: Changed the way how objectives are kept silent on change of players
    side. This thread (http://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=32415)
    explains how to do that.
  - Minor format changes suggested by wmlindent, wmllint and wmlscope


********** Previous releases were for BfW 1.8 only **********


----- 1.0.3, 19 Dec 2010 -----

- S4: Small change to opening dialog to make it clearer that several experienced
  units should be sent with Norfindil and Vaddan
- S10: Added (very simple) death speech by the Chief
- S10: Staff bearer will not use it on defense until Norfindil has been
  converted back


----- 1.0.2, 8 Dec 2010 -----

- S2: Fixed a bug that did not save Vaddan in a variable if he was killed in S2


----- 1.0.1, 24 Oct 2010 -----

- S2: player also gets gold and map when killing Vaddan, not only when letting
  him join (to get rid of a tomato surprise); also fixed a typo that only gave
  the player 20 gold when it was supposed to be 26 on letting him join.


----- 1.0.0, 13 Oct 2010 -----

- First post to forum
- Next day (Oct 14): added to add-on server
